I trust this message finds you well. I've been receiving a steady stream of requests regarding this project that was set aside five years ago due to sponsorship challenges. Should there be anyone willing to offer sponsorship or support, of any kind, for this project, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email. I am more than open to the possibility of resuming and revitalizing the project with your valued assistance.

It's worth noting that over the years, my proficiency in software development has seen significant growth. This has led to a reevaluation of certain aspects of the existing codebase, with the potential for a substantial overhaul to align with current standards.

In addition, I've had the privilege of working with various APIs in the travel and hospitality industry, including the Amadeus EPower API, Sabre, Galileo, TBOHolidays, Guesty, and more. This presents a unique opportunity to expand the project's capabilities and seamlessly integrate these cutting-edge technologies.

The enduring interest in this project is truly heartening, and I am genuinely excited about the prospect of rejuvenating and enhancing it, with the support of passionate sponsors and collaborators. Please do not hesitate to reach out via email if you'd like to explore this further.
