I have been receiving numerous requests regarding this project, even five years after its abandonment. The primary reason for discontinuing this project was sponsorship-related issues. However, if anyone is willing to provide sponsorship or support for this project in any way, please feel free to reach out to my email address. I would be more than willing to consider resuming and updating the project with your assistance.

I should note that over the years, my skill level has evolved significantly. I've gained new insights and best practices in software development, which have led me to reevaluate some of the practices in the existing codebase. It's possible that the project may require a substantial overhaul to bring it up to current standards.

In addition to this, I've also implemented other APIs, including the Amadeus EPower API. So, there's an opportunity to expand the project's functionality and integration with these new technologies.

I appreciate the continued interest in this project, and I look forward to potentially revitalizing and enhancing it with the help of interested sponsors and collaborators. Please don't hesitate to get in touch with me via email if you're interested in discussing this further.
